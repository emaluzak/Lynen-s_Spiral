    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Character: Research Topic\n",
    "The project explores fatty acid β-oxidation. It is a spiral pathway that breaks down long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH₂. This process fuels ATP production. The project focuses on visualizing this process through a web-based app built with Streamlit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dietary lipids are first broken down by pancreatic and intestinal lipases into:\n",
    "• Glycerol\n",
    "• Fatty acids\n",
    "\n",
    "These fatty acids are activated to fatty acyl-CoA and transported into the mitochondria.\n",
    "β-oxidation happens in the mitochondrial matrix, mainly in liver cells.\n",
    "Each cycle shortens the fatty acid by 2 carbon atoms.\n",
    "The main products are:\n",
    "• Acetyl-CoA → enters the Krebs cycle\n",
    "• NADH and FADH₂ → go to the electron transport chain\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdown continues until the entire fatty acid is consumed.\n",
    "This stepwise cleavage of carboxylic acids was discovered in 1904 by Georg Franz Knoop.\n",
    "The exact reactions were mapped out in 1951 by Feodor Lynen."

    "2. Setting: Niche\n",
    "Beta-oxidation is commonly taught through lectures, textbooks, and static pathway charts, which often present the process in a fixed and abstract manner. While these resources cover the core concepts, they rarely offer interactive experiences that let students engage with the pathway dynamically. What’s missing is a visual, step-by-step tool that helps learners follow each reaction in real time and understand how molecular changes drive energy production. This gap defines a clear niche: educational biochemical visualization tools designed to make complex metabolic processes more accessible and intuitive."

    "3. Problem\n",
    "Despite its importance in metabolism, β-oxidation is often perceived as abstract and difficult to grasp. Students frequently struggle with its spiral structure, where each cycle involves subtle molecular changes that are hard to visualize. It becomes even more challenging when trying to understand how variations in fatty acid length or saturation influence the number of cycles and ATP yield. Without a clear, dynamic representation, the pathway remains a complex concept, making it difficult for learners to connect reaction steps to energy production in a meaningful way."

    "4. Solution\n",
    "Lynen’s Spiral is a web-based app built with Streamlit to support step-by-step exploration of fatty acid β-oxidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app features three interactive pages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Home\n",
    "Introduces key concepts such as: \n",
    "• What is a fatty acid? \n",
    "• Why are fatty acids important? \n",
    "• The role of NADH and FADH, and ATP as the energy currency\n",
    "Users can select or construct a fatty acid based on chain length and saturation.\n",
    "Both 2D and 3D structures are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lynen Spiral\n",
    "A 3D spiral visualizes all the oxidation cycles.\n",
    "Each step (dehydrogenation, hydration, oxidation, and thiolysis) is marked along the spiral.\n",
    "The model is interactive and can be rotated.\n",
    "For any selected cycle and step, the product structure can be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanisms\n",
    "Displays ATP yield calculations, including total ATP, activation cost, FADH₂ yield and NADH yield.\n",
    "Users can view individual cycles or all cycles at once.\n",
    "Each reaction step includes reactants, products, and a brief description.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining structural models, pathway logic, and energy accounting, the app transforms β-oxidation into a visual and interactive learning experience.\n",
    "This helps learners connect molecular structure to reaction steps and energy output."
