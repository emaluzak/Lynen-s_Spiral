    "INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Character: Research Topic\n",
    "The project explores fatty acid β-oxidation. It is a spiral pathway that breaks down long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH₂. This process fuels ATP production. The project focuses on visualizing this process through a web-based app built with Streamlit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dietary lipids are first broken down by pancreatic and intestinal lipases into:\n",
    "• Glycerol\n",
    "• Fatty acids\n",
    "\n",
    "These fatty acids are activated to fatty acyl-CoA and transported into the mitochondria.\n",
    "β-oxidation happens in the mitochondrial matrix, mainly in liver cells.\n",
    "Each cycle shortens the fatty acid by 2 carbon atoms.\n",
    "The main products are:\n",
    "• Acetyl-CoA → enters the Krebs cycle\n",
    "• NADH and FADH₂ → go to the electron transport chain\n",
    "\n",
    "The breakdown continues until the entire fatty acid is consumed.\n",
    "This stepwise cleavage of carboxylic acids was discovered in 1904 by Georg Franz Knoop.\n",
    "The exact reactions were mapped out in 1951 by Feodor Lynen."

    "2. Setting: Niche\n",
    "Beta-oxidation is commonly taught through lectures, textbooks, and static pathway charts, which often present the process in a fixed and abstract manner. While these resources cover the core concepts, they rarely offer interactive experiences that let students engage with the pathway dynamically. What’s missing is a visual, step-by-step tool that helps learners follow each reaction in real time and understand how molecular changes drive energy production. This gap defines a clear niche: educational biochemical visualization tools designed to make complex metabolic processes more accessible and intuitive."

    "3. Problem\n",
    "Despite its importance in metabolism, β-oxidation is often perceived as abstract and difficult to grasp. Students frequently struggle with its spiral structure, where each cycle involves subtle molecular changes that are hard to visualize. It becomes even more challenging when trying to understand how variations in fatty acid length or saturation influence the number of cycles and ATP yield. Without a clear, dynamic representation, the pathway remains a complex concept, making it difficult for learners to connect reaction steps to energy production in a meaningful way."

    "4. Solution\n",
    "Lynen’s Spiral is a web-based app built with Streamlit to support step-by-step exploration of fatty acid β-oxidation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app features three interactive pages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Home\n",
    "Introduces key concepts such as: \n",
    "• What is a fatty acid? \n",
    "• Why are fatty acids important? \n",
    "• The role of NADH and FADH, and ATP as the energy currency\n",
    "Users can select or construct a fatty acid based on chain length and saturation.\n",
    "Both 2D and 3D structures are displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lynen Spiral\n",
    "A 3D spiral visualizes all the oxidation cycles.\n",
    "Each step (dehydrogenation, hydration, oxidation, and thiolysis) is marked along the spiral.\n",
    "The model is interactive and can be rotated.\n",
    "For any selected cycle and step, the product structure can be shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mechanisms\n",
    "Displays ATP yield calculations, including total ATP, activation cost, FADH₂ yield and NADH yield.\n",
    "Users can view individual cycles or all cycles at once.\n",
    "Each reaction step includes reactants, products, and a brief description.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining structural models, pathway logic, and energy accounting, the app transforms β-oxidation into a visual and interactive learning experience.\n",
    "This helps learners connect molecular structure to reaction steps and energy output."

    "\n",
    "            The project implements a computational model of fatty acid β-oxidation, the primary metabolic pathway for fatty acid degradation, using an object-oriented approach with two main classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "            FattyAcidMetabolism (base class): Handles basic fatty acid properties and theoretical calculations. Additionally contains prototype methods to modelize beta oxidation.\n",
    "            EnhancedFattyAcidMetabolism (derived class): Extends the base class with detailed reaction modeling using SMARTS patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Molecular Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "            Fatty acids and their intermediates are represented as RDKit molecule objects, created from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation. This representation enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Accurate modeling of molecular structures\n",
    "            Precise tracking of atom positions and bond types\n",
    "            Identification of functional groups via SMARTS patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "        Reaction Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "            Chemical reactions in the β-oxidation pathway are modeled using SMARTS reaction patterns, which define transformations between molecular structures. The implementation includes specific patterns for each step of the β-oxidation cycle, as defined by the SMARTS_REACTIONS dictionnary. These patterns use atom mapping to track specific atoms through the transformation, ensuring chemical accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Simulation Logic Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "            The simulation follows a hierarchical structure that mirrors the biological process:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. Input Processing and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "            The _process_input method interprets input as SMILES strings and creates molecular representations.\n",
    "            Basic molecular properties are calculated, including chain length and double bond positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Activation and Transport (Preparatory Phase)\n",
    "\n",
    "            Activation: The activate_fatty_acid method simulates the ATP-dependent activation of fatty acids to acyl-CoA derivatives.\n",
    "            Transport: The carnitine_shuttle method conceptually represents the transport of acyl-CoA molecules into the mitochondrial matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. β-Oxidation Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "            The core simulation occurs in the beta_oxidation_cycle method, which executes four sequential steps, using the run_reaction method:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Dehydrogenation: Removal of hydrogen atoms to create a double bond, with special handling for pre-existing double bonds.\n",
    "            Hydration: Addition of water across the double bond.\n",

    "            Thiolysis: Cleavage of the molecule to release a two-carbon acetyl-CoA unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "            For fatty acids with existing double bonds, the system automatically detects their position using the find_carbonyl_carbon, get_alpha_beta_gamma_carbons, has_alpha_beta_double_bond and has_beta_gamma_double_bond methods, and applies the appropriate isomerase-assisted dehydrogenation pathway.\n",

    "                5. Return final results and summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "            Each cycle removes two carbon atoms until the fatty acid is completely degraded.\n",
    "\n",
    "            5. ATP Yield Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "            ATP yield is calculated based on the cofactors generated during β-oxidation:\n",
    "\n",
    "            FADH₂ (from dehydrogenation): 1.5 ATP equivalents\n",

    "\n",
    "        To provide a 2D visualization of molecules, the mol_to_svg_image() function is used. It takes a molecular object as input and outputs an SVG image. Special post-processing is applied to clean XML tags to comply with Streamlit’s rendering requirements. This method ensures molecules are visualized in high resolution with clearly labeled atoms and bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Structural Interpretation (smiles_to_delta)\n",
    "\n",
    "        To enrich chemical understanding, the smiles_to_delta() function converts a SMILES string into a delta-notation descriptor (e.g., 18:1(Δ9)), identifying the total carbon count and positions/configurations of double bonds. The function parses atom connectivity to identify the carboxylic acid carbon and traverses the carbon backbone, recording bond types and stereochemistry (cis/trans) when present. This output provides a concise yet chemically informative summary for user-displayed molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2D Structure Output (display_2d_structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "        This function retrieves the molecular object from session state. It displays:\n",

    "\n",
    "    3D Molecular Visualization (display_3d_structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "        For spatial understanding, display_3d_structure() generates a 3D plot of the molecule using RDKit’s 3D embedding (EmbedMolecule) and energy minimization (MMFFOptimizeMolecule). The molecule is rendered in an interactive Plotly figure, with atoms displayed as spheres and bonds as styled lines (e.g., double bonds rendered as parallel lines). Color and size mappings visually differentiate atom types (e.g., red for oxygen, grey for carbon), and stereochemistry is preserved.\n",

    "        2. Custom Molecule Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "        Users specify chain length and input desired double bond positions. The validate_double_bond_input() method ensures:\n",

    "\n",
    "        3. SMILES Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "            Based on user inputs, build_fatty_acid_smiles() programmatically assembles a custom SMILES string, accounting for geometric isomerism. The string begins with a carboxylic acid head and appends carbon atoms, inserting /C=C\\ or /C=C/ as dictated by cis/trans preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "            When the user presses \"Visualize Fatty Acid\", the SMILES is parsed via RDKit. The resulting molecule is stored in session state alongside metadata (smiles, notation, name, mol, processor = EnhancedFattyAcid), and the app navigates to the Visualizer tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. Navigation and Display\n",

For custom fatty acid creation, interactive form fields prompt users to define chain length (adjustable via a slider) and specify double bond positions and their configuration (cis/trans). A validation system prevents chemically impossible configurations, such as double bonds at invalid carbon positions, ensuring users generate only feasible structures.\n",
