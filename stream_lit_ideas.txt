Q to ChatGPT: On streamlit, is it possible to make several pages: home page: input of the fatty acids 
(choose eaither from a library or customize the fatty acid yourself, with a visual representation of 
the fatty acid after) one the visualization done, you click on a button at the bottom to access to the new 
page which draws a 3d lynen sprial (beta oxidation of fatty acids) with all the cycal steps. On this page, 
if you click on a specific step of the cycle, it pops up the mechanism, the molecule, atp etc... then you 
access Page 3 by clicking on the cycle, it gives you a 2D representation of all the steps of the specific cycle, 
with again the mechanism, molecules, maybe an animation to go from one step to another, either linearly or 
in a circular form (whichever easier).

ChatGPT's response:
Yes â€” everything you just described is possible in Streamlit, and quite elegantly too. Youâ€™re outlining a multi-page interactive biochemical app with:

    User input and molecular visualization

    3D metabolic cycle visualization (Lynen spiral for Î²-oxidation)

    Mechanism-level drill-down and animations

Let me break it down by page and give implementation notes and tools to use.
ðŸ”¹ Page 1: Fatty Acid Input & Visualization

Functionality:

    User selects a fatty acid from a dropdown or inputs a custom SMILES string.

    Displays 2D molecular structure.

    Button to proceed.

Tools to Use:

    st.selectbox() for library options

    st.text_input() for custom SMILES

    rdkit.Chem.Draw.MolToImage() or rdkit.Chem.Draw.rdMolDraw2D for rendering

    st.button() to move to Page 2 (or use session state to flip page logic)

ðŸ”¹ Page 2: 3D Lynen Spiral (Î²-oxidation Pathway)

Functionality:

    Shows 3D representation of Î²-oxidation spiral.

    Clickable steps (e.g., hydration, oxidation, thiolysis).

    Displays ATP count, intermediate molecules, mechanism image.

Tools to Use:

    3D Rendering: py3Dmol, embedded in Streamlit via components.html

    Clickable UI: st.button(), st.selectbox() or st.plotly_chart() with click events

    State handling: st.session_state to track selected step

    Mechanism pop-up: use st.expander() or st.modal() (Streamlit 1.25+)

ðŸ”¹ Page 3: 2D Cycle Mechanism View

Functionality:

    Show full cycle in 2D (linear or circular layout)

    Animate or step through mechanism steps

    Interactive display of molecular structure + ATP yield per step

Tools to Use:

    Graph layout: networkx + matplotlib, or plotly for circular layout

    Step-wise animation: st.slider() to choose step

    Display molecules: RDKit for images or SMILES

    Optional animation: simulate with timer + st.empty() loop

âœ… Navigation Between Pages

Use Streamlitâ€™s native multipage support:
File Structure:

my_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ Home.py
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1_Fatty_Acid_Input.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2_Beta_Oxidation_3D.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 3_Cycle_2D_View.py

Each page can read and update st.session_state to pass molecule objects, selected steps, and pathway metadata.
